## Making changes to Typhon

1. Search for related issues that cover what you're going to work on. It could
   help to mention there that you will work on the issue.

   For far-reaching changes, please investigate possible blockers and design
   implications, and coordinate with maintainers before investing too much time
   in writing code that may not end up getting merged.

   If there is no relevant issue yet and you're not sure whether your change is
   likely to be accepted, open an issue yourself.

2. Check for pull requests that might already cover the contribution you are
   about to make.

3. Check the [Typhon documentation](./doc/src/hacking.md) for information on
   building Typhon and running it.

4. Make your change!

5. Create a pull request for your changes.

   * Clearly explain the problem that you're solving. Link related issues to
     inform interested parties and future contributors about your change. If
     your pull request closes one or multiple issues, mention that in the
     description using `Closes: #<number>`, as it will then happen automatically
     when your change is merged.
   * Make sure to have a clean history of commits on your branch to help with
     the review process. Rebase when necessary but don't overuse force pushes
     once the PR is opened as they mess up the discussion.
   * Mark the pull request as draft if you're not done with the changes.
